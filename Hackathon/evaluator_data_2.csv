The probability of default is calculated at 22%, placing the customer in the Low Risk category. The earliest month triggering intervention is May 2016 (1461974400000), where a significant increase in ECL MoM Charge was observed.

0.85,Very High Risk,1.50E+12,Intervention needed,"The customer exhibits a very high risk of default, with a probability of default calculated at 85%. This is primarily driven by a significant increase in delinquency, utilization, and ECL charges over the observed period. The earliest month triggering intervention is June 2017 (1498780800000), where a sharp decline in cumulative profit and a substantial increase in ECL charges were noted. The customer's FICO score has consistently declined, and their debt-to-income ratio has surged, indicating financial distress. The revolving balance has also increased dramatically, further exacerbating their risk profile. Immediate intervention is recommended to mitigate potential losses and provide financial counseling or restructuring options to the customer. Monitoring should continue to assess the effectiveness of the intervention and adjust strategies as needed",Customer B
0.85,Very High Risk,1.63E+12,Intervention needed,"The customer exhibits a very high risk of default, with a probability of default calculated at 85%. This is primarily due to significant negative changes in key financial indicators. The earliest month triggering intervention is June 2021 (1625011200000), where the MoM Cumulative Profit turned negative, driven by a substantial increase in ECL and delinquency. The customer's FICO score has been declining, utilization has increased significantly, and there have been multiple delinquencies and credit inquiries. The total debt and debt-to-income ratio have also risen sharply, indicating financial distress. Immediate intervention is recommended to mitigate potential losses. The bank should consider contacting the customer to discuss their financial situation, offering financial counseling, or restructuring their debt to prevent further deterioration. Continuous monitoring is also essential to track any further deviations from expected financial behavior",Customer C
0.75,High Risk,1.66E+12,Intervention needed,"The customer's financial risk has escalated significantly over the observed period. Initially, the customer maintained a low revolving balance and exhibited no delinquency, resulting in a steady increase in cumulative profit. However, starting from month 33 (timestamp: 1661904000000), there was a notable shift in behavior. The customer's revolving balance increased sharply, leading to higher utilization rates and multiple delinquencies. This resulted in a substantial increase in ECL and a significant drop in cumulative profit. The probability of default is calculated at 75%, primarily driven by high delinquency (22%), increased utilization (22%), and a declining FICO score (20%). The earliest month triggering intervention is month 33, where the cumulative profit turned negative, and the ECL saw a significant rise. Immediate intervention is recommended to address the underlying issues, such as potential financial distress or mismanagement, to prevent further deterioration of the customer's financial health. Monitoring alone may not suffice given the rapid decline in key financial indicator",Customer D
0.45,Medium Risk,1.71E+12,Intervention needed,"The customer initially exhibited stable financial behavior with a high FICO score of 760, zero delinquency, and a consistent debt-to-income ratio. However, significant deviations began in the 38th month when the income category changed to 'Less than $40K' and the revolving balance increased sharply. This led to a substantial increase in utilization and a decrease in FICO score. The ECL MoM Charge also saw a dramatic rise, indicating higher expected credit losses. The cumulative profit turned negative in the 40th month, driven by a sharp increase in ECL and utilization. The probability of default is calculated at 45%, placing the customer in the Medium Risk category. The earliest month triggering intervention is the 40th month, where the cumulative profit saw a significant drop due to increased ECL and utilization. Immediate intervention is recommended to address the rising risk factors and prevent further financial deterioration. Monitoring the customer's financial behavior closely and offering financial counseling or restructuring options could help mitigate the risk",Customer E
